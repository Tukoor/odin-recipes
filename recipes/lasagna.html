    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This horrifying masterpiece was taken fresh off of reddit's r/shittyfoodporn.
         Needless to say, I wouldn't recommend recreating this creative, but vomit inducing, dish.</p>
    <p><em>the depression part is that it's not even Lasagna</em></p>
     <h3>Ingredients Needed</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>linguine</li>
            <li>grean peas</li>
            <li>carrots</li>
            <li>mini corn chunks</li>
            <li>a sauce of your choice. Feel free to use your imagination</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h4>Preparing the Dish</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>We will be starting off by cooking the linguine in boiling water of your choice.</li>
            <li>As the linguine starts to cook, head out to your garden and pick some fresh peas and carrots.
                dress them as if they were to be the "belle of da ball".</li>
            <li>Once the vegetables are all dapper, throw them into the boiling water with the linguine.</li>
            <li>Use your best judgement to tell when everything is cooked, as i have no actual knowledge when it comes to cooking.</li>
            <li>Once everything is cooked, lay the linguine onto some fresh foil (use your preferred brand).</li>
            <li>mix the veggies into the sauce that you chose in the beginning and layer it all ontop of the linguine.</li>
            <li>Congragulations! Your dish is ready to serve, and you are now ready to induce your guests with projectile vomiting.</li>
            
        </ol>
